Application URL : http://localhost:8080/loginexttest/

Enhancements :

1. Apache CXF is used as it provides both SOAP and Rest Web Service.
2. We can use AuthenticationHandler as well but in current case not necessary.
3. We can also keep database connection credential file in tomcat/lib.

Steps :
Use Sql File to create schema and table.
Change database configuration in jdbc.properties.

mvn clean install -DskipTests
Deploy in Tomcat
Access using http://localhost:8080/loginexttest/
